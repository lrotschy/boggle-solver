# Boggle Solver 

## Resources

-  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/746082/how-to-find-list-of-possible-words-from-a-letter-matrix-boggle-solver 
I got the idea of using a queue to keep track of valid prefix strings from this discussion.

- npm scrabble library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrabble 
Generates all English words that can be created from the letters in a given string. I used it to create the "dictionary" that I used to check whether my boggle strings were words or prefixes of words.
